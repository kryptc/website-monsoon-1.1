		<strong> <em> INTRO DE </em> </strong>
		<br> <br>
		<em> Hi, I'm Kripa </em> and I'm currently in my first year, doing my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. I spent the last twelve years of my life on a little island in the Middle East, called Bahrain. My interests are large and varied; but mainly include reading and writing fiction, theatre, cooking and web development.

		 <strong> <em> MY EARLY NOMADIC YEARS </em> </strong>
		 <br> <br>
		 I was born on a balmy day in late September in a city called Kollam in Kerala. I spent a year in India before moving to Malaysia where I did my pre-schooling. Later, I shifted to Muscat where I lived for a year and finally, left for the bright beaches of Bahrain. Ever since, I've identified the 750 square kilometre island as my home and remains the site of some of my fondest memories and relationships. Over the years, Bahrain has come to be known for being one of the most liberal Arab nations with a pretty high standard of living. My favourite things about Bahrain extends from the Formula One grand prix and the concerts that accompany it to the niche spots around city with their delightful dining spots.

		<strong> <em> SCHOOL++ </em> </strong>
		<br> <br>
		I completed my secondary schooling from The Asian School and did my 11th and 12th grade in the Indian School, Bahrain. I've always been passionate about languages and political science but I also enjoy math and computer programming. I used to frequently participate in quizzes, debates and MUNs and also used to be a part of the Prefect Council. Additionally, I used to play in the school table tennis and basketball team (a very surprising fact, considering how little I am). I enjoy trying my hand at everything because there's an undeniable sense of freedom and joy while learning something new.

		 <strong> <em> TRIPLE EYE TEA </em> </strong>
		 <br> <br>
	
 		 Joining college opened up a world of possibilities to me and I intend to explore as much as I can. I find web design and development especially interesting, but I also want to learn more about information security and forensic data analysis. I place a lot of importance on extracurriculars, which is why I want to spend my time improving my literary and creative side, as well as get involved in small-scale marketing and management.
